# encrypted-file-sharing-platform
##  Description
This project focuses on designing and developing a secure web-based file sharing platform that guarantees confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access to shared files. The system ensures that files remain protected throughout their lifecycle, from upload to download.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a secure file sharing solution using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Files are encrypted before being uploaded and can only be decrypted by authorized users. The server never stores files in plaintext format, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected even if the storage system is compromised.
